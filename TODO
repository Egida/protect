    Sketch out client

    Sketch out server

    Generalize relay module so it's the "network next" kernel module instead. It can be used by server, and by backends.

TODO

    Setup terraform on the project and build SDK, kernel module, client, server and test

    ------

    Implement client backend with XDP, model it on the relay

    Implement server with XDP (so we can do relay-like stuff and return )

    Should we implement client and server backend in XDP? I think yes. We want this to be as scalable and low-cost as possible

    Sketch out client backend

    Sketch out server backend

    Extend relay to support
