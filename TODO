    Implement the server zero copy packet receive interface on the server

    Actually read the sequence number for the direct packet and then adjust the packet data and packet bytes

    Verify that the server sees the packets sent from the client and the correct sequence number and packet bytes

    Convert the server over to have SoA for send buffer

    Convert the client to internally use a receive buffer.

    This will allow greater flexibility wrt. packet receiving and possibly we can do packet receives on a background thread with minimal effort.

    Implement a client background thread pumping the receive packet once every millisecond protected by mutex.

    Pump the receive packets once on main thread as will, right before we actually process them (to catch any packets in the last millisecond intra...)

TODO

    Implement the ping near relays state of client init

    The trick here is that not only do we want the set of relays to ping, we also want...

    1. more relays to ping than can fit in one response packet

    2. an estimate of best cost from each relay to the destination

    This will allows us to quickly stop pinging relays that have demonstrated after 1 second that they are probably not suitable

    Think of it sort of a progressive refinement

    It also will let us in the common case very quickly decide, ok, these relays are fine, let's go.

    -------------

    Implement handshake to pick a client slot (index)

    -------------

    Implement timeouts on the server side for client slots

    -------------

    Fix up all the hacked code to actually use client slot system when sending/receiving packets etc.

    Extend the server so it uses AF_XDP to send and receive packets on linux

    -------------

    Implement a server XDP program that does the packet filtering and checks for the server before passing down to userspace

    -------------

    Implement endian fix up for packet structs

    -------------

    Fix the connect token so we never send the user hash over un-encrypted channels

    This involves doing key exchange and switching over to more advanced crypto primitive

    Add these primitives to proton and then upgrade the code in protect to do the key exchange at the same time as processing the connect token
